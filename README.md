# MachineCode
# Machine Data Generator

## Overview
This project is a Python script designed to generate and store machine data in a SQLite database. It simulates the operations of multiple machines across different axes, updating parameters such as tool offset, feed rate, and tool usage at specified intervals.

## Features
- Generates random values for machine parameters based on defined constraints.
- Stores machine and axis data in a SQLite database.
- Updates data periodically to simulate real-time monitoring.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   -bash
   git clone https://github.com/pradeep-kumar-angamuthu/MachineCode.git
   cd MachineCode
